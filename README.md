# data-analysis-with-python
this is a data analysis project of students score where i have used python libraries like
1)numpy

I have analysed the students score on various factors and concluded few points like
1)females are more than males
2)student's scores are related to their parent's educational qualification
3)student's scores are independent of their parent's marital status
4)no student has obtained 0 in reading or writing but students have 0 in mathematics
5)people belong to majory five ethnic groups
